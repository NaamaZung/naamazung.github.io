# Naama Zung's Github Page
## welcome to my page, please beware of the step before you get in!

My name is Naama and I am a Ph.D student in [Maya Schuldiner's lab](https://mayaschuldiner.wixsite.com/schuldinerlab) 
at the [Weizmann Institute](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). 


During the day I am investigating unknown protein functions in baker yeast. 
At night I like to drink beer that was made with baker yeast 

Here are some of my publications to convince you that my love to yeast is mutual:

-[Cnm1 mediates nucleus-mitochondria contact site formation in response to phospholipid levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34694322/)

-[New horizons in mitochondrial contact site research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324151/)

Both projects will are focusing on how organelles (tiny organs inside our cells) communicate for the cell to function properly


But don't be mistaken! I am not just a yeast lover.
I am a parent of a dog that I already discovered **HIS main function**- Sleeping.
